# Architecture knowledge (index)

**This file is deliberately thin.** The canonical, committed architecture sources for this repo are:

| Source | Role |
|---|---|
| `docs/architecture.md` | Canonical module map, dependency rules, threading rules, bridge layout |
| `docs/constitution.md` | Authoritative tech/architecture decisions |
| `.github/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md` | Consolidated agent reference (Architecture Rules section) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Quick-start summary + the 6 "must not violate" rules |

Do **not** duplicate those here — update them (via the repo's `architect`/`documenter` flow) instead.
This file only records architect verdicts and open questions that do not yet belong in `docs/`.

## Standing rules used in fit-checks (pointers, not restatements)

1. Repository-mediated persistence; no SQLite from ViewModels.
2. No NDI SDK types cross the bridge boundary; `[DllImport("ndi")]` only in `src/MauiApp/NdiBridge/Interop/`.
3. No business logic in Views.
4. Bridge events raised on pump threads; marshal via `IMainThreadDispatcher` (Core) / `MainThread` (MauiApp).
5. Android APIs isolated in `Platforms/Android` behind Core interfaces; `Noop*` elsewhere.
6. Every captured NDI frame must be freed; pump threads must never throw out.

Note on rule 5 scope: `src/MauiApp` targets **only** `net10.0-android`
(`src/MauiApp/NdiForAndroid.csproj:4`), so `Android.*` type usage inside `src/MauiApp` compiles
unconditionally. Rule 5's intent is to keep Android APIs out of **Core** and out of
**testable/portable logic** — not to ban every `Android.Util.Log` call in the MAUI app layer
(precedent: `src/MauiApp/NdiBridge/NdiRuntime.cs:174`).

## Verdicts log

### 2026-09-04 — Soak-test logcat instrumentation (NdiViewerBridge stats + LogBridgeEvent mirror)

**APPROVE-WITH-CHANGES.** Runtime `IsDiagnosticOverlayService.IsDeveloperMode` gate accepted as the
debug flag (a `#if DEBUG` gate would not work for the intended Release-build device soak).
Direct `Android.Util.Log` in `src/MauiApp` accepted (app layer, Android-only TFM, existing
precedent) — no new Core abstraction warranted for temporary instrumentation.
Required change: `DiagnosticOverlayService._isDeveloperMode`
(`src/MauiApp/Features/DiagOverlay/DiagnosticOverlayService.cs:13`) is read from NDI pump threads
and must be `volatile` (or accessed via `Volatile.Read`) once cross-thread reads are introduced.
Constraints: 1 Hz only, nothing in the per-frame path, max-gap field stays pump-thread-confined,
logging must never throw into the pump loop.

### 2026-09-04 — Fase-4 fixplan (FIX-01..FIX-17 + D8 option 1)

**APPROVE-WITH-CHANGES overall.** Verdicts per fix in the session report. Binding decisions:

- **FIX-02 (OutputPage half): REJECTED.** `OutputPage` is a `ShellContent` `ContentTemplate` target
  (`src/MauiApp/AppShell.xaml:43,72`), i.e. Shell-cached for the section lifetime — identical to the
  `HomePage` disposal bug FIX-03 removes. Disposing its transient `OutputViewModel` in
  `OnDisappearing` would permanently kill `OutputStatusChanged` + `AppResumed` after the first tab
  switch. Rule: **only push-navigated pages may dispose their ViewModel from page lifecycle;
  ShellContent-hosted tab roots must not.**
- **FIX-04 route strings:** `//stream-tab` hardcoded in Core (`SourceListViewModel`) and in
  `DeepLinkService` conflicts with `docs/architecture.md` Navigation rule 5 (placement-adaptive
  `-tab` vs `-rail` routes). Accepted **only** as an interim with a `TODO` + follow-up issue for a
  placement-aware route resolver; `docs/architecture.md` Navigation rule 4 ("OutputPage … does not
  accept a query parameter") must be amended to allow `reStreamSourceId`/`isReStreamMode`.
- **FIX-09:** public/Core split must use `ConfigureAwait(false)` on every `SemaphoreSlim.WaitAsync`
  (`NdiOutputBridge.Dispose` blocks synchronously on these methods) and must convert **both**
  internal `StopOutputAsync` call sites (`NdiOutputBridge.cs:80` and the catch at `:134`).
- **FIX-11:** `VideoInputKind` already lives in Core (`src/Core/Services/ICaptureSources.cs:4`), so
  the signature change stays Core-only — approved. The `captureMicrophone` parameter is **not**
  derivable in the video path (`IVideoCaptureSource.StartAsync` has no mic flag), so the FGS keeps
  permission-gating `TypeMicrophone`; only `TypeMediaProjection`/`TypeCamera` become kind-gated.
- **D8 option 1: APPROVED** — `IDiagnosticOverlayService` is a Core contract
  (`src/Core/Features/DiagOverlay/Services/IDiagnosticOverlayService.cs`), so calling it from Core's
  `DiscoveryRefreshService` respects layering. Inject as a trailing **optional** ctor parameter.

### 2026-09-04 — Placement-aware primary navigation (A) + handoff timing (B)

**APPROVE-WITH-CHANGES (both).** Follow-up to the FIX-04 interim; confirmed by tablet rail-mode testing.

**A — `INavigationService.NavigateToPrimaryAsync(PrimaryNavDestination, string? queryString)`.**
Approved; retires the `TODO(nav-rule-5)` markers in `SourceListViewModel.NavigateToOutputAsync` and
`DeepLinkService.NavigateToOutputForReStreamAsync`. **No Core `IPrimaryRouteResolver`** — `//x-tab`
/`//x-rail` are Shell URIs, a MAUI-layer concern; Core must not learn Shell routing.
Required change: **no `Shell.Current as AppShell` downcast.** Move the two route dictionaries
(`AppShell.xaml.cs:12-28`) into `ShellNavigationService`, injecting the singleton
`AdaptiveShellStateViewModel` (`MauiProgram.cs:122`) for `IsLeftRailNavigationVisible`;
`AppShell.TryGetRouteForCurrentPlacement` then delegates to it. One route table, no duplicated
fallback. Still owed from the fase-4 verdict: amend `docs/architecture.md` Navigation rule 4
(`OutputPage` may accept `reStreamSourceId`/`isReStreamMode`) and rule 2/5 for the new method.

**B — handoff moved to `OnNavigating` with a deferral.** Approved in principle; five blocking changes:
1. `ParseDestination` (`AppShell.xaml.cs:242-251`) must match on the **path only** (split on `?`).
   Ordered `Contains` puts `stream` before `view`, so `//view-rail?reStreamSourceId=…` parses as
   **Stream**. Live bug today: `viewer?sourceId=<name containing "stream">` fires a View→Stream
   handoff whose `StopReceiver()` kills the viewer just opened.
2. `GetDeferral()` is unavailable when `args.CanCancel` is false — null-check and fall back to the
   current post-navigation handoff; keep `OnShellNavigated` as the reconciliation point for
   `_currentPrimaryDestination`, guarded so the handoff cannot double-fire.
3. `base.OnNavigating(args)` first; bail if `args.Cancelled`.
4. `try/finally` around `Complete()` and swallow+log handoff exceptions — an escaped exception
   wedges *all* Shell navigation permanently.
5. Latency: the deferral holds the old page while `StopOutputCoreAsync` tears down
   MediaProjection/camera (`NdiOutputBridge.cs:165-193`). Reorder the handoff so
   `SaveAsync(IsOutputActive=false)` precedes `StopOutputAsync`, and cap the deferral with a
   timeout so a wedged stop cannot freeze navigation (ANR).

Placement-change path is safe: `EnsurePrimaryDestinationVisibleAsync` keeps the same destination, so
`from == to` short-circuits (`NdiNavigationHandoffService.cs:29`). Guard `ApplyPlacement`'s dispatched
`GoToAsync` against landing while a deferral is pending.

### 2026-09-04 — B: Home quick actions (#328)

**APPROVE-WITH-CHANGES.** T001 AWC · T002 REJECT · T003 AWC · T004 AWC · T005 A · T006 AWC ·
T007–T010 AWC. #328 lands **after** #326/#334 (worktree `…-wt/output`), on top of that branch's
`HomeViewModel` (which gains an `INdiOutputBridge outputBridge` 5th ctor parameter, a
`_outputBridge` field, an `OutputStatusChanged` subscription that re-runs `RefreshCommand`, and a
corroborated `OutputStatus` condition). Full A verdict lives in the output worktree's copy of this
file.

1. **T002 REJECT — `NavigateToAsync("viewer?sourceId=…")` from Home pushes under `//home-tab`.**
   `AppShell.ParseDestination` matches `home` first (`AppShell.xaml.cs:274`), so the location
   resolves to **Home**, `NdiNavigationHandoffService`'s `View` branch never fires, and
   `ViewerViewModel.Dispose()` does **not** call `StopReceiver()` — the NDI receiver keeps running
   after the user leaves (docs/architecture.md NDI Bridge rule 4: stop native sessions on route
   transitions). Fix: `await NavigateToPrimaryAsync(PrimaryNavDestination.View);` then
   `await NavigateToAsync($"viewer?sourceId={Uri.EscapeDataString(...)}")`, so the push lands under
   `//view-tab`/`//view-rail`. Alternative (larger, viewer-owned): make `ViewerViewModel.Dispose()`
   stop the receiver.
2. **T001/T003 seam over A (exact).** No 7th ctor parameter — reuse A's `_outputBridge`. In
   `RefreshAsync`'s existing `_dispatcher.BeginInvokeOnMainThread` block compute once:
   `var outputActive = state.IsOutputActive && _outputBridge.IsActive;` → `OutputStatus` from
   `outputActive`; `LastOutputStreamName = state.StreamName;`
   `CanResumeOutput = !outputActive && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(state.StreamName);`.
   plan.md's persisted-only interim rule and its "prefer a read model over a direct bridge
   dependency" follow-up note are **superseded** — the direct `INdiOutputBridge` dependency is
   approved and already present after A. A's `OnOutputStatusChanged` → `RefreshCommand` makes
   `[NotifyCanExecuteChangedFor(nameof(CanResumeOutput))]` update live with no extra wiring.
   Note `StopOutputCommand` persists `StreamName = null`, so Resume stays disabled after a
   deliberate stop — intended semantics.
3. **T006 REQUIRED — drop `state.IsOutputActive` from `ApplyResumeRequestAsync`'s gate.** After A,
   that flag is cleared whenever the bridge does not corroborate, so the command would be dead code
   in exactly the resume scenario. Gate on `!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(state.StreamName)` only.
   Use A's exact string `"Tap Start to resume output"` (**no** trailing period) in both ViewModels
   and in T008's assertion — plan.md currently has both spellings.
4. **T004 — disabled-not-hidden APPROVED.** Verify on device that the explicit
   `BackgroundColor="{DynamicResource Primary}"` / `SuccessGreen` still yields a visibly disabled
   button; if not, add a `Disabled` VisualState using `DynamicResource` only.
5. **T005 APPROVED** (`resume` `[QueryProperty]`, `else if` after the `reStreamSourceId` branch —
   mutually exclusive entry points, lifecycle wiring only, Rule 3 respected). Doc debt:
   `docs/architecture.md` Navigation rule 4 must be amended to list `resume` alongside
   `reStreamSourceId`/`isReStreamMode`.
6. Not starting capture from `ApplyResumeRequestAsync` is the correct invariant — no silent
   MediaProjection re-consent. All tests remain reachable from `tests/MauiApp.Tests`; only T004's
   visual disabled state needs device verification.

## Open questions / assumptions

- Assumed this instrumentation is **permanent, low-cost diagnostics** rather than throwaway; if it
  is throwaway, it should be reverted after the soak rather than documented in `docs/architecture.md`.
